"""The single step-matcher evaluator.

Both the dry-run preview (`source_probe.bucket_items_by_step`) and the
materialise remap (`materialise.remap_transitions`) decide "does this
transition belong to this step?" through `matcher_matches` here, so the
preview can never diverge from what materialise actually writes.

A transition has two axes:
  - `signal` — the named lifecycle event (`github-pr-merged`, …);
  - `stage`  — the label / status / raw stage text.

An `event` matcher targets `signal` (via the source's code→signal map);
`label` / `status` / `stage` matchers target `stage`.
